# Minecraft RL

These are the code files of a project in-the-works. I have already written most of the code for this project, yet I will only release the next portion of code each time I release the next section of my tutorial on Towards Data Science. You can view the ongoing tutorial here: https://towardsdatascience.com/@ryanrudes.

In [section 1.1](https://medium.com/@ryanrudes/minecraft-rl-part-1-1-416fc555bc26), we defined custom `Color`, `Block`, and `Ore` objects.

In [section 1.2](https://medium.com/@ryanrudes/minecraft-rl-part-1-2-5de7844001e7), we created `Point2D` and `Point3D` objects for specifying cartesian coordinate positions in the generated chunk and height map. Then, we overrode the `np.ndarray` class to create custom `Chunk` and `HeightMap` objects. Finally, we began the terrain generation algorithm by writing the height map generator.
