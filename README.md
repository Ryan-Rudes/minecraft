These are the code files of a project in-the-works. I have already written must of the code for this project, yet I will only release the next portion of code each time I release the next section of my tutorial on Towards Data Science. You can view the tutorial here: https://medium.com/@ryanrudes.

In section 1.1, we defined custom `Color`, `Block`, and `Ore` objects.
